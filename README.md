### Beam Simulation Container (radiasoft/beamsim)

The following particle accelerator and free electron laser (FEL) simulation
codes are installed in the radiasoft/beamsim container:

* [elegant](http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/software.shtml#elegant)
  is an accelerator code that computes beta functions, matrices,
  orbits, floor coordinates, amplification factors, dynamic aperture,
  and more. It does 6-D tracking with matrices and/or canonical
  integrators, and supports a variety of time-dependent elements.
* [Hellweg](https://github.com/radiasoft/rslinac) simulates
  high-average-power, traveling wave (TW) electron linacs, including
  the important effects of beam loading. It can also be used for
  modeling beam transport with a variety of standard elements.
* [JSPEC](https://github.com/zhanghe9704/electroncooling) is an open
  source C++ package for numerical simulations on the electron cooling
  process, including the intrabeam scattering (IBS) effect, developed
  at Jefferson Lab (JLab).
* [OPAL](https://gitlab.psi.ch/OPAL/src/wikis/home) (Object Oriented
  Particle Accelerator Library) is an open source C++ framework for
  general particle accelerator simulations including 3D space charge,
  short range wake fields and particle matter interaction.
* [Shadow3](http://forge.epn-campus.eu/projects/shadow3)
  is used to study propagation of a photon beam through an optical
  system. The program is general, but is optimized for the case of
  X-rays and reflective optics such as those encountered in the XUV
  and in Synchrotron Radiation.
* [Radia](http://www.esrf.eu/Accelerators/Groups/InsertionDevices/Software/Radia/Documentation/Introduction)
  solves physical and technical problems one encounters during the
  development of Insertion Devices for Synchrotron Light
  Sources. However, it can also be used in different branches of
  physics, where efficient solutions of 3D boundary problems of
  Magnetostatics are needed.
* [SRW](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW)
  is a physical optics computer code for calculation of detailed
  characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation (SR) generated by
  relativistic electrons in magnetic fields of arbitrary configuration
  and for simulation of the radiation wavefront propagation through
  optical systems of beamlines.
* [Synergia](https://web.fnal.gov/sites/Synergia)
  implements fully
  nonlinear and symplectic independent-particle physics, as well as
  symplectic linear maps and arbitrary-order polynomial maps. It
  includes collective effects, including space charge and wake fields,
  in various approximations ranging from the very simple to
  computationally-intense, 3-dimensional field calculations.
* [Warp](http://warp.lbl.gov)
  simulates charged particle beams with high space-charge intensity
  with the ability to simulate Warped (bent) Cartesian meshes. This
  bent-mesh capability allows the code to efficiently simulate
  space-charge effects in bent accelerator lattices (resolution can be
  placed where needed) associated with rings and beam transfer lines
  with dipole bends.
