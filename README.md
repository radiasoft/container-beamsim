### Beam Simulation Container (radiasoft/beamsim)

The following simulation codes are installed in the radiasoft/beamsim container:

* [elegant](https://rsft.us/beamsim/elegant)
  is an accelerator code that computes beta functions, matrices,
  orbits, floor coordinates, amplification factors, dynamic aperture,
  and more. It does 6-D tracking with matrices and/or canonical
  integrators, and supports a variety of time-dependent elements.
* [EPICS](https://rsft.us/beamsim/epics) is a set of Open Source software
  tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used
  worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for
  scientific instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes
  and other large scientific experiments.
* [HYPRE](https://rsft.us/beamsim/hypre) is an open source library of
  linear solvers makes possible larger, more detailed simulations by
  solving problems faster than traditional methods at large scales. It
  offers a comprehensive suite of scalable solvers for large-scale
  scientific simulation, featuring parallel multigrid methods for both
  structured and unstructured grid problems.
* [JSPEC](https://rsft.us/beamsim/jspec) is an open
  source C++ package for numerical simulations on the electron cooling
  process, including the intrabeam scattering (IBS) effect, developed
  at Jefferson Lab (JLab).
* [OPAL](https://rsft.us/beamsim/opal) (Object Oriented
  Particle Accelerator Library) is an open source C++ framework for
  general particle accelerator simulations including 3D space charge,
  short range wake fields and particle matter interaction.
* [Pydicom](https://rsft.us/beamsim/pydicom) is a pure Python package for working
  with DICOM files such as medical images, reports, and radiotherapy objects.
* [PyMesh](https://rsft.us/beamsim/pymesh) is a rapid prototyping
  platform focused on geometry processing. PyMesh is written with both
  C++ and Python, where computational intensive functionalities are
  realized in C++, and Python is used for creating minimalistic and
  easy to use interfaces.
* [Radia](https://rsft.us/beamsim/radia)
  is a magnet design code used for insertion devices for Synchrotron light
  sources. It can be used wherever efficient solutions for 3D boundary problems of
  magnetostatics are needed.
* [SRW](https://rsft.us/beamsim/srw)
  is a physical optics computer code for calculation of detailed
  characteristics of Synchrotron Radiation (SR) generated by
  relativistic electrons in magnetic fields of arbitrary configuration
  and for simulation of the radiation wavefront propagation through
  optical systems of beamlines.
* [Synergia](https://rsft.us/beamsim/synergia)
  implements fully
  nonlinear and symplectic independent-particle physics, as well as
  symplectic linear maps and arbitrary-order polynomial maps. It
  includes collective effects, including space charge and wake fields,
  in various approximations ranging from the very simple to
  computationally-intense, 3-dimensional field calculations.
* [Warp](https://rsft.us/beamsim/warp)
  simulates charged particle beams with high space-charge intensity
  with the ability to simulate Warped (bent) Cartesian meshes. This
  bent-mesh capability allows the code to efficiently simulate
  space-charge effects in bent accelerator lattices (resolution can be
  placed where needed) associated with rings and beam transfer lines
  with dipole bends.
* [Zgoubi](https://rsft.us/beamsim/zgoubi) calculates
  trajectories of charged particles in magnetic and electric
  fields. At the origin specially adapted to the definition and
  adjustment of beam lines and magnetic spectrometers, it has so
  evolved that it allows the study of systems including complex
  sequences of optical elements such as dipoles, quadrupoles,
  arbitrary multipoles, FFAG magnets and other magnetic or electric
  devices, and is able as well to handle periodic structures.
